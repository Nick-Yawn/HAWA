# Welcome to HAWA

HAWA makes CRUD-app planning easy. Create projects, then quickly add:
- Features
  - Routes*
  - User Stories*
    - Acceptance Criteria*

When your project is ready, easily convert to GitHub-friendly wiki docs:*
- Routes X Feature
- User Stories X Feature
- Acceptance Criteria X User Story X Feature

*ETA June 2022

Please feel free to file an issue for bug reports or feature requests. You may also check [the Sprint Board](https://github.com/Nick-Yawn/HAWA/projects/1) to see what work is in progress or coming up.

# How To Use HAWA

To create a Project, click the "Start a Project" button, type your project name, and press "Enter":

Once you've created your Project, add Features by clicking on the "Add a Feature" button, typing the name of the feature, and pressing "Enter." The form remains open so you can quickly add more features if desired. Click the background or press "Escape" to close the form.

# Looking Ahead

HAWA was created to solve a very real pain point, but it is not yet useful at the time of writing. Work will continue over the coming weeks to add the requisite minimum functionality for actual use by CRUD-app developers, including: adding Routes and User Stories to Features; adding Acceptance Criteria to User Stories; and converting Projects to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

Beyond the goal of minimum viability, I would like to improve the Quality of Life for users through the additions of: the sharing of Projects with other users for team projects, sockets for simultaneous love editing, and reviews. 

Detailed plans for the implementation of these features can be found at the following links, or in the sidebar:
